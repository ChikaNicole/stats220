# Hello!
*This is Nicole's website!*


## Some information about me:
I am an university student and my major is **statistics**. I am an native speaker of Chinese and I can also speak English and Japanese also with some German and Korean because I am an amateur of languages~ I like music especially J-POP!

## This is `the first time that I use code to make a meme!`
Below is a meme I made using the R package {magick} of saga(who is a character in Arknights).

You can also check it with this url:http://localhost:27749/session/preview.jpeg

## My motivation of making this meme
* Saga is a very popular character in Arknights.
* I got the idea that she likes eating natto rice and she always want to eat which is very funny from the story line so I screenshotted her and make this meme.


## How my meme is new/original 
I use my screenshot to make the first picture of my meme and I use another screenshot of a video from a website called bilibili and then put the two pictures together with what I think she's going to say on the right-hand side to make this meme so that it is a new/original meme.

## The r code that I used to make the meme
